# Collaborating on TeamsFx Project
The previous version of Teams Toolkit is not easy for multiple users to develop the same project due to missing privilege to access Teams APP and AAD APP for another developer. If multiple developers want to share remote resources and work together, they need to manually handle permissions for Teams App and AAD APP which need deep understanding the low-level details about the TeamsFx project.


Latest version of Teams Toolkit now natively support add other collaborators for TeamsFx project which is much easy and straightforward for collaborative development.


## Collaborating - Use VSCode

### Usage
- To use collaboration feature, you need to **login M365 and Azure account** and your **TeamsFx project should be provisioned first**

- In the Teams Toolkit panel, click Environment, and expand an environment name, there will be a Collaborators node

  ![collaborators node](./collaborator-node.png)


- Click grant permission button on the right side of Collaborators node, then you can add another M365 account email address as collaborator

  ![collaborators node](./input-collaborator-email.png)

- Now collaborator with the added account can develop, provision and deploy the project


### E2E Work Flow in VSCode
#### Creator
- Open VSCode, create a new TeamsFx Tab project (You can also select bot), and the hosting type select Azure

- Login M365 account and Azure account

- Provision and deploy your project, after provision success, you will see your m365 account listing below Collaborators node in Teams Toolkit panel

    ![collaborators node](./collaborator-node.png)

-	Add another account as collaborator from tree view by click the grant permission button. Note that the added account must under the same tenant

- Push your project to GitHub

#### Collaborator
- Clone the project from GitHub
-	Login M365 account use collaboratorâ€™s account
-	Login Azure account which has contributor permission for all the Azure resources
-	Update Tab code, and deploy the project to remote
-	Launch remote and the project should work fine
