## Collaborating on TeamsFx Project
The previous version of Teams Toolkit is not easy for multiple users to develop the same project due to missing privilege to access Teams APP and AAD APP for another developer. If multiple developers want to share remote resources and work together, they need to manually handle permissions for Teams App and AAD APP which need deep understanding the low-level details about the TeamsFx project.


Latest version of Teams Toolkit now natively support add other collaborators for TeamsFx project which is much easy and straightforward for collaborative development.
